# CoralConnectivityResilience_2Reef_Project
Code associated with running and plotting model of two reefs connected by coral and macroalgal dispersal. All code was generated by me (Ariel Greiner) and all outputs were generated between 2017-2021. Please contact me if you have any issues running the code. MATLAB code was used to determine the equilibria of the system of ODEs and determine the stability of the eigenvalues at those equilibria. R code was used to organize the matlab output, generate (using deSolve v. 1.21) + plot the trajectories of the system of ODEs and then graph the full output. BASH Code was used to run code for generating the trajectories of the system of ODEs in compute canada (https://www.computecanada.ca/, server farm accessible to Canadian researchers) so that they could be run faster and in parallel.

Ed. Note (2.2023): Added a Repository Guide file, went through and made sure that all code was uploaded and that it was clear what all code was written to do. The code is still set up as it was on my computer before I moved it to Github but should be easy enough to track everything down.

Ed. Note (7.2022): All of the code used for the project has been uploaded, I ran another set of simulations for a 4th scenario (unequal dispersal, heterogeneous grazing) that did not end up getting used in the paper that is not included here but is available upon request.

Ed. Note (4.2021): At the moment the code has not been cleaned (plenty of code I ended up not using for the final product, etc) and is not well-commented, but it is all uploaded here to give an idea of the code that I used for this project.
